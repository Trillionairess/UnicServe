## Background

Access to finance and effective cooperative savings systems is limited in rural and underserved communities. Traditional savings groups lack predictive insight into liquidity or individual saving behaviors.

**Problems solved:**
- Inconsistent savings patterns
- Poor group liquidity planning
- Limited visibility into individual financial goals

UnicServe was born to empower cooperatives with data-driven predictions and planning tools. This is particularly valuable in developing economies where financial literacy and group accountability are key.

## How is it used?

UnicServe works like a digital assistant for cooperatives:

- Members register and input savings history.
- AI predicts future contributions based on past trends.
- Admins see dashboards showing liquidity forecasts, member performance, and savings goals.
- Alerts are generated when anomalies or risks are detected.
- Used by cooperative admins, members, financial NGOs, and government-backed savings initiatives.

## Data sources and AI methods

**Data:**  
- User savings history  
- Group contribution trends  
- Local economic indicators (optional)

**AI Techniques:**  
- Time Series Forecasting (LSTM or Prophet)  
- Clustering for behavior segmentation  
- Anomaly detection with Isolation Forest

## Challenges

- Predicting behavior with little or no historical data
- User resistance to digital tools in rural areas
- Privacy concerns and data protection

## What next?

- Integrate mobile USSD for low-tech users
- Deploy in real cooperative pilot programs
- Build credit scoring models based on user data
- Explore partnerships with MFIs and government
